- Remembers how long your crafts really take, so its time guesses get better the
  more you play.
- Tells you how long a craft will take — for one item or a whole job — right on
  the AE2 screens, so you know when to come back.
- Marks scheduled work as waiting until its first pattern dispatch, so you can
  tell that it hasn't started yet.
- Alerts you when a craft has stalled, so you can fix it instead of waiting
  forever.
- Shows what's slowing you down — like a machine that's too slow, too few
  Pattern Providers, or not enough Crafting Co-Processors — and how to speed it
  up.
- Shows how close its time guesses were after a craft finishes, so you can trust
  the numbers.
- Adds time, colors, totals, and sort buttons to the AE2 crafting screens, so the
  info is easy to read at a glance.
- Lets you Ctrl-Alt-click an entry to erase old, wrong stats for that item.
- Works with Applied Mekanistics chemicals, and adds time hints to ME Requester
  rows and totals, when those mods are installed.
- Only shares summary stats with other players on the server — never your items
  or your base.
- Keeps what it learned inside your world, so it stays smart after you quit and
  come back.

<summary>Development disclosure</summary>

Yes, AI helps me write this mod. I'm not really a Java guy, if you know what I
mean, but I have enough engineering experience to keep it from turning into
vibe-coded spaghetti. I direct and review the work, and I expect the code to be
tested, maintainable, scalable, and reusable. I hope that makes it clear where
AI fits into the project.

The mod does not use generative AI while running and does not include
AI-generated in-game visual assets. The README branding is separate.
