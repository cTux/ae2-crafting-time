# AE2 Addon Integration Implementation Plan

The version-selection work below is planned. The later sections retain the
earlier native-integration roadmap; they are not evidence that every historical
phase is still outstanding. Complete this feature as one conventional commit
following `AGENTS.md`; run local tests only after the hook creates its PR.

## Versioned adapter selection

Follow [VS-01 through VS-10](spec.md#versioned-adapter-selection) and the
[design](technical-design.md#versioned-adapter-selection). No dependency upgrades,
new Minecraft targets, gameplay changes, or issue #193 implementation are part
of this work.

### 1. Capture contracts and preserve regression artifacts

- Record exact dependency versions, download provenance, hashes, target/loader,
  and relevant bytecode signatures before changing adapters. Use the current
  compatible graph and the historical evidence linked in the design.
- Retain Forge NeoEco 20.3.0, 20.4.0, and 20.4.2 fixtures, plus NeoForge 21.1.1.
  Confirm the accounting-object, long/boolean, and integer-batch descriptors
  and trace normal/FastPath calls. Identify delegate overloads to avoid observing
  the same expected-output insertion twice.
- Use the exact original and Refreshed Crafting Tree fixture pairs in the
  design: CF 7182165 / MR flhDmaU7 for Forge and CF 7182163 / MR 35O4yt0D for
  NeoForge 1.21.1. Inspect widget/node bytecode and retain each artifact's hash.
  No Fabric release was found in the checked catalogues; preserve its existing
  declaration/packaging and test absence and selector fixtures without claiming
  a positive Fabric Tree smoke. Missing retained contract or newest-adapter proof still
  prevents completing this feature.
- Recheck loader bootstrap APIs at the compatible pins and declared floors.
  Use the four target-specific bridges in the design; no shared NeoForge API
  assumption across 1.21.1 and 26.1.2.

Gate: the catalogue has evidence-backed predicates and a retained old/new
contract fixture pair for each real API transition. Artifact retrieval and checks are
verification work; the architecture and compatibility policy are already fixed.

### 2. Add selection and its smallest meaningful tests

- Implement `IntegrationSelection` and `IntegrationSelectionTest` in shared
  pure Java. Select the first compatible candidate from the immutable ordered
  list. Return a decision and bounded reasons; do not mutate the catalogue.
- Cover absent dependency, unsupported target, physical side, old-only,
  new-only, both-compatible, incompatible-new/compatible-old, neither-compatible,
  independent dependencies, and deterministic ordering. Candidate IDs and
  ownership are validated; same-family common hooks are allowed, cross-family
  ownership conflicts are not.
- Add the fixed catalogue and early bootstrap bridge/plugin. Cache a family's
  complete decision atomically across all plugin instances. Test callback order,
  concurrent/repeated queries, two Forge configs, and feature-setting/world
  changes against the same process decision.
- Check real small bytecode fixtures for missing classes/members, wrong return
  kinds, inherited members, and overlapping contracts. Exercise probe I/O and
  malformed-bytecode errors separately from normal incompatibility. Tests must
  assert the selected mixin bundle, not just repeat catalogue constants.
- Use existing JUnit and Mixin/ASM dependencies. Put loader-free probe logic in
  a testable shared seam if it needs branches; do not exclude it from coverage.
  Require 100% line and branch coverage for new or changed executable behavior
  under the repository's existing coverage policy.

### 3. Gate packaged hooks and split only the differing NeoEco dispatch

- Add `plugin` to shared pre-26, Forge AdvancedAE, NeoForge 1.21.1, and NeoForge
  26.1.2 mixin configs. Preserve their side lists and existing core hook behavior.
- Gate the two Tree variants using the fixed catalogue. Retain their distinct
  spacing, tooltip, node access, and click behavior. Do not rewrite working UI
  algorithms as part of this selection change.
- Split NeoEco's three-descriptor redirect into `NeoEcoPendingDispatchMixin`,
  `NeoEcoLongBatchDispatchMixin`, and `NeoEcoIntBatchDispatchMixin` under the
  existing `mc1201` mixin source directory. Put the network-aware dispatch
  callback behind `NeoEcoDispatchObserver`; the shared lifecycle mixin remains
  included in each variant bundle and is gated off when none is selected.
- Gate existing AdvancedAE, Lightning Tech, and Requester singleton adapters
  for the exact target/side inventory in the design. Do not expand declarations
  just because a string-target class is packaged in a shared source set.
- Add one selection/skip log per dependency and a read-only snapshot for future
  diagnostics. Keep selected hooks pending until exercised; no hook rollback,
  broad catch, new activation states in packets, or runtime reselection.

Gate: every addon-owned mixin maps to its selected family bundle; core AE2
mixins still apply. A known no-match vetoes the entire optional bundle before
application. Unexpected probe and post-application failures propagate.

### 4. Verify packaging and the actual runtime matrix

After the implementation commit's hook creates its PR, follow the applicable
development, test-driver, and prepared-client smoke skills. Build production
and driver artifacts on the host; run clients sequentially inside CodexVM.
Use English (`en_us`) for all scenarios. Smoke only the newest implemented
adapter per dependency/target; retained old fixtures receive contract and
packaging tests without extra runtime campaigns. Follow
[SP-01 through SP-04](../automated-ui-testing/spec.md#smoke-policy).

| Target | Required startup and behavior evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1.20.1 Forge | Core-only client and dedicated server; Refreshed Tree `tree-layout`; NeoEco 20.4.2 `batched-long` normal/FastPath CPU paths; AdvancedAE extra-config absence/presence; Lightning Tech and Requester regressions; two addons together. |
| 1.20.1 Fabric | Core-only client and dedicated server; Requester regression; Tree absence and selector fixtures; Forge-only CPU variants never accepted or class-loaded. No positive Tree runtime claim without a published Fabric artifact. |
| 1.21.1 NeoForge | Core-only client and dedicated server; Refreshed Tree `tree-layout`; NeoEco 21.1.1 `batched-int` CPU; AdvancedAE, Lightning Tech, and Requester regressions; two addons together. |
| 26.1.2 NeoForge | Core-only client and dedicated server; AdvancedAE CPU regression; pre-26 Tree, Requester, NeoEco, and Lightning Tech adapters excluded. Native coverage of an installed addon does not imply a custom adapter is present. |

- Extend existing `crafting-tree-screen`, `neoeco-cpu`, `advancedae-cpu`,
  `lightningtech-cpu`, and `merequester-screen` scenarios only where they cannot assert
  newest-adapter selection, English UI behavior, or duplicate prevention. Reuse the driver
  registry and shared state machine; keep fixture content out of production.
- In CPU cases, assert selected CPU, accepted job, actual expected-output and
  returned-output amounts, a fresh sample, normal/FastPath completion, and TTC
  in the reopened plan. Assert counts/amounts so duplicate sampling cannot pass.
  In UI cases, inspect node badges/spacing, tooltips, details/reset, row totals,
  and the absence of duplicated lines or input handling.
- Use controlled development-only bytecode fixtures for both-eligible,
  incompatible-new/compatible-old, no-match, unexpected probe errors, and
  post-selection failure. Verify first-match behavior and that no fallback
  occurs after application. A synthetic overlap test proves exclusivity only;
  real artifacts must prove that the selected hook reaches the active path.
- Inspect built JAR contents, configs, refmaps, variant membership, singleton
  platform bridge, and absence of bundled addon/driver classes. Test production
  namespaces through native-loader artifact launches, not only dev classpaths.
- Run `scripts/validate-optional-integrations.ps1` and its existing regression
  script, the applicable Gradle tests/coverage and target builds, then the final
  compatible UI suite for all four targets because shared bootstrap changes
  reach all of them. Follow the smoke skill's final-base-refresh rule. Latest
  launches cannot replace the required newest-adapter smoke. Do not run direct
  older-adapter cases even when compatible pins select them; use focused newest
  fixtures instead.
- Archive exact versions/hashes, selected IDs/reasons, startup/server logs,
  per-scenario results, and visually reviewed checkpoints using
  `docs/ui-smoke-evidence.md`. Report third-party failures separately and retain
  failed attempts. Run applicable CPU behavior on dedicated servers as well as
  integrated servers; client-only Tree/Requester variants stay skipped there.

### 5. Reconcile documentation and close the acceptance gate

Update `docs/dependencies.md` and `docs/mod-automation-coverage.md` with verified
variants and artifact evidence, retaining all existing minima and optionality.
Update the startup-diagnostics inventory/snapshot consumer if #193 lands first;
otherwise keep the documented handoff. Mark this planned selection work
implemented only after the following evidence is complete.

| Acceptance | Proof owner |
| --- | --- |
| VS-AC-01 | Steps 1, 3, 4: retained artifact contracts and packaging, separate variants, newest-adapter English smoke. |
| VS-AC-02 | Steps 2, 4: selector and bytecode fixtures, exact winning bundle and no-match skip. |
| VS-AC-03 | Steps 2, 4: independent family decisions plus real multi-addon sample/UI checks. |
| VS-AC-04 | Steps 3, 4: config/packaging checks and core-only physical client/server launches on all targets. |
| VS-AC-05 | Steps 2, 4: cached decisions across config instances, callback order, world/config changes. |
| VS-AC-06 | Steps 2, 3, 4: bounded selection logs and preserved probe/runtime failure evidence. |
| VS-AC-07 | Steps 1 through 5: coverage, packaged artifacts, all retained API contracts, truthful docs and metadata. |

Done means all seven acceptance checks pass, every new executable branch is
covered, older variants retain contract coverage, newest adapters have English
runtime proof, required CI is green,
and the implementation PR contains reviewed artifact/log/screenshot evidence.
Missing required contract fixtures or newest-adapter runtime proof remain
explicit blockers;
neither a compatible pin nor a green compile can replace them.

## Development client matrix

1. Keep one compatible lock and one dynamic latest mode for every supported
   target.
2. Put the shared project list and every compatible version in
   `scripts/run-client-versions.json`; do not duplicate dependency lists in
   wrappers.
3. Reject missing compatible transitive pins and keep latest resolution errors
   visible.
4. Keep latest worlds, configs, and managed mods under `run-latest`.
5. Cover PowerShell and Bash selection, pins, dynamic versions, target
   isolation, cleanup, and invalid profile data with deterministic checks.

Done when all eight wrappers route to the correct profile and both resolver
implementations produce the same target-specific graph.

## Phase 1: Prove existing native coverage

1. For every candidate CPU, inspect whether each hooked
   `CraftingCpuLogic` method is inherited, overridden, redirected, or replaced.
2. Record the exact supported mod version and Minecraft/loader row.
3. Test OmniSequence first. Replace the current competing redirect only if an
   in-game craft proves that its inherited path misses `ProfilerBridge.start`.
4. Close candidates that already work through layer 0 without adding code.

Done when a normal output-producing craft starts, records output, finishes, and
shows TTC without duplicate samples.

## Phase 2: Spike service-level lifecycle observation

1. On one custom CPU, verify whether AE2's `CraftingService.getCpus()` returns
   it and whether submission goes through `submitJob`.
2. If it does, extract a small pure-Java busy-state tracker with tests for new,
   busy, finished, cancelled, removed, and duplicate CPUs.
3. Add thin `CraftingServiceMixin` adapters for the supported AE2 API source
   sets.
4. Do not merge the observer if it sees only vanilla `CraftingCPUCluster`
   instances already covered by layer 0.

Done when the spike proves additional real coverage without double-counting.

## Phase 3: Add only required custom CPU adapters

Work in this order because the source investigations already identify the hook
points:

1. NeoEco (`ECOCraftingCPULogic`).
2. AE2 Lightning Tech (`Ae2LtTimeWheelCraftingCpuLogic`).
3. Any later addon whose execution path still bypasses layers 0 and 1.

For each addon:

- reuse `ProfilerBridge` and the AdvancedAE adapter pattern;
- hook actual pattern dispatch, accepted output, finish, and used capacity;
- keep the mixin optional and absent-mod safe;
- add resource membership checks and the closest boundary tests;
- verify cancellation, partial output, parallel work, and a successful craft.

## Phase 4: Verify key types without addon handlers

1. Exercise each candidate `AEKey` with its real `getAmountPerUnit()` value.
2. Confirm the same normalized amount reaches profiling, estimates, snapshots,
   display, and reset lookup.
3. Add no code when the native contract works.
4. If two types produce the same profile ID, stop and plan a separate saved-data
   and packet format migration before changing `ProfileKey`.

Done when every tested key type either works through `AeKeyAmounts` or has a
specific, reproduced contract gap.

## Phase 5: Reuse AE2 UI seams

1. Check whether each candidate screen uses `CraftConfirmTableRenderer` or
   `CraftingStatusTableRenderer`, or inherits their hooked description and
   tooltip methods.
2. Verify those concrete renderer paths without new code. Do not count reuse of
   `AbstractTableRenderer` alone as TTC support.
3. Look for one stable `AEBaseScreen` method only after the table path is ruled
   out.
4. Add a bespoke `@Pseudo` mixin only for a fully custom screen or API, starting
   with the player-visible crafting screens.
5. Close candidates such as range boosters or visual tools when they have no TTC
   surface.

## Final compatibility sweep

- Run required CI for every changed supported row.
- Launch each named modpack only through its matching Prism test workflow.
- Test with each optional addon present and absent.
- Check that samples are recorded once, persisted, requested, reset, and shown.
- Update `docs/dependencies.md`, loader metadata, and candidate status only for code
  and versions that were actually verified.
