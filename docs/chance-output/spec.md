# Chance-based output diagnostics

Status: draft

Scope: Research and proposed status for non-guaranteed processing outputs.

Issue: [#471](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/issues/471).

Open gate: Identify a real machine/mod/version and a trustworthy server-side
mapping from the dispatched pattern to its effective output probability.
Final wording, color, precedence, and alert timing remain planning decisions.
No detector or runtime qualification is claimed.

## Problem and evidence limits

An encoded processing pattern promises a fixed output. A machine that returns
that output only by chance can leave AE2 waiting: 100 operations at 60% chance
produce 60 outputs on average, not a guaranteed 60 or a guaranteed completion.

The issue's pinned AE2/source research found no standard probability field in
`IPatternDetails`. Successful provider dispatch adds expected outputs; accepted
returns reduce the waiting amount. Neither observation proves the machine has
finished its attempts. Slow processing, missing fuel, blocked routing, and
unloaded machines can produce the same partial-return symptom.

`CraftProfiler` and `CraftingCpuLogicMixin` already observe outstanding output,
progress, and lifecycle. Reuse these boundaries; do not estimate recipe chance
from the ratio of observed returns to dispatched output or from network stock.

## Proposed behavior to validate

- Provisional **CHANCE OUTPUT** applies only when a supported server integration
  proves that the job's encoded output is not guaranteed. Show a percentage only
  when its exact effective value is known.
- Explain that AE2 may wait for missing output. On a delayed row, include
  job-specific outstanding amount and idle time only when those values are known.
- Preserve concrete blocker statuses and retain applicable chance context in the
  tooltip. Unknown mappings stay DELAYED with a conditional suggestion to check
  for chance outputs, never a confirmed diagnosis.
- Reuse owner-targeted delayed alerts, server settings, and episode deduplication.
  Do not emit duplicate generic/chance messages merely because chance is present.
- Explain recovery: inspect routing and machines, remove optional random byproducts
  from promised outputs, or stock random outputs independently. Cancel and correct
  an unrecoverable job. Extra inputs and batching do not guarantee success.

No scheduler changes, automatic retries/cancellation, invented outputs, or
probability-based TTC correction are requested. The eventual status needs an
on/off option through the existing options model.

## Design and verification prerequisites

Map evidence by job/CPU, pattern, and output; one global output ID is insufficient
for mixed producers. Verify upgrades, pack changes, ambiguous factory patterns,
and effective server recipes. A recipe-browser tooltip is not server authority.
Keep snapshots bounded and detection server-owned; avoid per-tick full recipe scans.
Define reset, cancellation, completion, unload/reload, and stale-evidence handling.

A deterministic fixture may dispatch 100 promised units and return exactly 60
to verify 40 outstanding. Test a real chance recipe separately without expecting
an exact random yield. Cover zero returns/no history, partial and late returns,
guaranteed main outputs with chance byproducts, multiple CPUs, mixed producers,
and deterministic slow/blocked negative controls.

Review both source variants, packet implementations, status composition,
`TtcText`, `ProfilerBridge`, snapshot caches/codecs, and notifications. Qualify
Forge/Fabric 1.20.1 and both NeoForge targets, explicitly excluding unsupported
addon mappings. If no reliable mapping exists, retain that research result;
a conditional hint alone does not complete the requested status.

## Documentation and completion

After behavior is implemented and verified, update English/Ukrainian UI text,
GuideME status pages and indexes, DELAYED cross-links, and diagnostic guidance.
Publish and verify equivalent English/Ukrainian GitHub wiki pages and navigation.
Use reviewed runtime captures, not proposal images.

Explain the detection limits, recovery, and average-yield example. Reconcile the
issue's reported DELAYED documentation timing discrepancy against current
configuration/code rather than copying the old 30-second claim.
[#412](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/issues/412) is related guide work,
not an established blocker. Retain exact source, test, CI, and publication evidence
before closing the feature.
