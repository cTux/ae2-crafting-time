# In-game Configuration Screen Specification

Status: draft

Scope: In-game configuration screen.

Planning: [original plan, PR #280](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/pull/280); [revised plan](implementation-plan.md).
Open gate: review the expanded per-feature switches and mockup before implementation.

Issue: [#117](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/issues/117)

## Goal

Let players and server owners turn off each player-facing runtime feature without
turning off unrelated features. Local display and personal notification choices
belong to the client; profiling and shared behavior remain server-authoritative.

## Entry points and layout

- Forge and NeoForge expose **Configure** from this mod's loader details page.
- Fabric exposes the same screen through optional Mod Menu integration. The mod
  still loads and its config files still work when Mod Menu is absent.
- The root has **Client** and **Server** tabs. Client groups are Displays,
  Warnings, Appearance, and Controls. Server groups are General, Diagnostics,
  Notifications, Integrations, and Advanced. Each group has its own page or scroll region.
  Every row shows its current value, default, valid range or choices, and a
  short English or Ukrainian explanation. The Server tab is read-only for
  players without edit permission, with the effective server value still shown.
- The [options mockup](options-mockup.svg) shows the proposed grouping and the
  personal warning mute. It is a design preview, not an implemented screen.
- **Done** saves valid changes. **Cancel** discards unsaved changes. Each section
  has **Reset section**, and the root screen has **Reset all**; reset changes are
  reviewable before **Done** writes them.
- Client-only changes apply as soon as **Done** is pressed. Server-owned changes
  made by an authorized local/server operator apply on the next supported config
  reload; otherwise the screen explains that a reconnect, world reload, or
  server restart is required.

## Settings

### Server-owned

| Setting | Default | Valid values | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profiling and TTC (`enabled`) | on | on/off | Enables server profiling and the data used by TTC surfaces. |
| Retained samples (`maxSamples`) | `10` | `1`-`100` | Limits recent throughput and accuracy samples per output. |
| Outlier multiplier (`outlierMultiplier`) | `4.0` | `1.0`-`1000.0` | Sets the median-relative throughput filter. |
| Delayed and blocked notifications (`notifyOnDelayed`) | on | on/off | Global server permission to send private craft warning chat. |
| Chat details (`showChatMessages`) | on | on/off | Controls server-sent TTC details and reset notices. |
| Minimum no-progress time | `10 s` | `1`-`3600 s` | Earliest time at which an output can become delayed. |
| Typical-duration multiplier | `2.0` | `1.0`-`1000.0` | Required learned-duration multiple before an output becomes delayed. |

### Feature switches

Every switch defaults **on** to preserve existing behavior. Turning one off
removes only the named feature; it does not erase learned samples, change active
crafts, or silently turn off sibling features. The server profiling master
(`enabled`) is the exception: turning it off suspends all server-derived TTC and
diagnostics. It is clearly labelled as the master switch.

| Owner and group | Independent switches | Off behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client / Displays | Crafting Plan row TTC, Crafting Plan total, Crafting Status row TTC, Crafting Status total, CPU-card total, Crafting Tree TTC, ME Requester TTC | Hide the named surface only; unsupported integrations are shown disabled with a reason. |
| Client / Displays | Fast-to-slow TTC coloring, prediction accuracy, detailed tooltips, control hints | Hide the named detail or use neutral text color; estimates stay available. |
| Client / Warnings | Waiting-to-start, collecting-data, delayed, recurrent ingredient, and each blocked reason (`NO PROVIDER`, `NO POWER`, `NO SPACE`, `NO CHANNEL`, `NO TARGET`, `INPUT BLOCKED`) | Hide that status and its badge/tooltip on this client; other statuses and calculations remain. |
| Client / Warnings | Private craft warning chat | Mute delayed and blocked warning messages for this player, including the screenshot's repeated `is delayed` lines. Other players keep their own choice. |
| Client / Controls | Crafting Plan sort control, Crafting Status sort control, CPU-list TTC sort, TTC details click, reset-history click, provider-locate click | Hide or disable only the named control. A disabled sort control uses AE2 order; no server-side history is removed. |
| Server / Diagnostics | Prediction-accuracy recording, waiting-to-start tracking, delayed detection, recurrent ingredient detection, and each blocked reason (`NO PROVIDER`, `NO POWER`, `NO SPACE`, `NO CHANNEL`, `NO TARGET`, `INPUT BLOCKED`) | Stop collecting or classifying that named diagnostic for all clients; existing TTC estimation remains when profiling is on. |
| Server / General | World-save history | Stop future writes of learned throughput history; keep the existing world-save file so re-enabling can resume from it. |
| Server / Notifications | Private craft warning chat (`notifyOnDelayed`), Ctrl-click details/reset notices (`showChatMessages`) | Suppress the named server message for everyone without disabling diagnostics, clicks, or reset actions. |
| Server / Integrations | AdvancedAE, NeoEco, AE2 Lightning Tech CPU profiling, and Applied Mekanistics chemical statistics | Stop only the named optional adapter; base AE2 profiling continues. Unsupported targets show the switch disabled with a reason. |

The current `showInTree` value becomes the Crafting Tree display switch.
`notifyOnDelayed` remains the global server switch. A client's private-chat mute
is separate: a warning is delivered only when both switches are on. A local
mute must work on a dedicated server without operator permission.

The server sends the effective values needed for display and explanations after
login and when they change. Only the integrated-server owner or a player with
server operator permission level 4 can submit changed server values. The server
revalidates and saves them; dedicated-server files and permissions remain
authoritative.

### Client-owned

| Group | Settings and defaults |
| --- | --- |
| Displays | The independent on/off values in the feature-switch table. All default on where supported. |
| Sorting | Separate Crafting Plan and Crafting Status defaults. Both start at longest first, matching the current `2` mode. Choices are AE2 order, shortest first, and longest first. |
| TTC scale | Fast `#55FF55`, middle `#FFFF55`, slow `#FF5555`. |
| Status text | Waiting `#E0E0E0`, delayed/blocked `#FF5555`, collecting-data `#E0E0E0`, and total TTC `#E0E0E0`. |
| Badges | Background `#000000` with `176/255` opacity, matching `0xB0000000`. |

Options for a feature unavailable on the current target stay visible but disabled
and explain the missing mod or unsupported target. Guide book content,
translations, and packet safety limits are not independent runtime behaviors
and are not presented as off switches.

## Validation and recovery

- Text fields reject non-numeric, non-finite, and out-of-range values before
  saving. Color values use six-digit RGB; opacity uses `0`-`255`.
- A missing key uses its default. Existing valid values survive the upgrade.
  Existing `enabled`, `showInTree`, `showChatMessages`, `notifyOnDelayed`,
  `maxSamples`, and `outlierMultiplier` values migrate without changing meaning.
- A malformed client value falls back only that value. A malformed server value
  follows the loader's config correction path and is logged without crashing a
  client or dedicated server.
- Unknown keys are preserved when the backing loader supports preservation and
  otherwise ignored; they never appear as invented UI options.

## Compatibility

The screen and matching behavior cover all four release-matrix targets:
Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge, Minecraft 1.20.1 Fabric, Minecraft 1.21.1 NeoForge, and
Minecraft 26.1.2 NeoForge. English and Ukrainian keys, defaults, validation, and
ownership remain aligned.

## Non-goals

- A new configuration library, web UI, command-only editor, or custom widget
  framework.
- Client authority over server profiling, persistence, chat, or diagnostics.
- Exposing packet limits, protocol constants, cache sizes, or other
  implementation-only values.
- Duplicating the TTC-details mouse binding from Minecraft's Controls screen.
- Changing crafting behavior, learned samples, or existing defaults merely by
  opening the screen.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every current config key and every setting above can be viewed and changed at
  its correct authority boundary on all supported targets.
- Loader and Mod Menu entry points open the same categorized screen, and Fabric
  works normally without Mod Menu.
- Save, cancel, section reset, full reset, invalid input, migration, reconnect,
  and restart-required states behave as specified.
- Display toggles, colors, opacity, default sorting, status visibility, and
  accuracy/detail visibility affect every listed UI surface without changing TTC
  calculations.
- A remote unprivileged client cannot change server-owned values; effective
  server values remain consistent between clients.
- Every feature switch listed above has a checked off/on case. A client can mute
  the screenshot's warning chat for itself on a dedicated server while another
  player continues receiving it; the server global switch suppresses it for all.
- English and Ukrainian labels have matching keys/placeholders, dedicated-server
  startup stays client-class-free, and all four release-matrix builds pass.
- Prepared-client smoke covers the loader entry point, editing, reset/cancel,
  immediate client updates, server-authority messaging, and persistence on every
  target.
