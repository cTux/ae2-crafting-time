# Dependencies

## Startup adapter selection

Optional hooks use one fixed startup choice per dependency. The first matching
API contract wins; older contracts stay packaged. Required AE2 hooks and all
loader dependency ranges are unchanged. A selected adapter is eligible for
application, not proof that its hooks have run. The immutable selection snapshot
is available through `IntegrationMixinPlugin.snapshot()`.

| Dependency | Adapter priority and target boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Crafting Tree | `tree-layout`, then `tree-helper`; client only, pre-26 targets. Fabric retains its declaration but has no verified published Tree artifact. |
| NeoEco | Forge: `batched-long`, then `pending-accounting`. NeoForge 1.21.1: `batched-int`. One dispatch adapter shares lifecycle hooks; neither family is enabled on Fabric or 26.1.2. |
| AdvancedAE | `advanced-cpu`; Forge and both NeoForge targets, both physical sides. |
| Lightning Tech | `time-wheel`; Forge and NeoForge 1.21.1, both physical sides. Its 26.1.2 native coverage does not imply a custom adapter. |
| ME Requester | `requester-screen`; pre-26 clients only. |

Raw class metadata is inspected before optional mixin application, without
initializing addon or Minecraft classes. Expected missing contracts skip the
whole family; unexpected read or bootstrap errors propagate. Selection is never
changed by later world, setting, or hook failures.

The retained [contract fixtures](../shared/src/test/resources/integration-contracts)
record released artifact URLs, SHA-512 hashes, and inspected member descriptors.
See [verification evidence](mod-automation-coverage.md#versioned-adapter-verification)
for the runtime acceptance state.

Pick the JAR that matches your Minecraft version and loader. Required versions,
optional integrations, development-client pins, and TestDriver coverage live here.
[Client and modpack coverage](mod-automation-coverage.md) records actual smoke
campaigns, client setup, exclusions, and the limits of those results.

The automated cross-target suite records every selected project in `coverage.json`:
direct UI, direct behavior, coexistence, tooling, or excluded with a reason.
Declared driver coverage is separate from each run's PASS/FAIL/NOT_RUN result.
`standard-ae2` adds plan/status input, real smelting, row states and output checks
to all four drivers. See [the suite specification](automated-ui-testing/spec.md).

## Required dependencies

These are required. The mod will not load unless your instance matches the row
for its JAR.

| Target jar | Required dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| `1.20.1 Forge` | Minecraft `[1.20.1,1.21)`, Forge `[47.1.3,)`, Applied Energistics 2 `[15.0.10,16.0.0)` |
| `1.20.1 Fabric` | Minecraft `1.20.1`, Fabric Loader `>=0.14.21`, Fabric API `>=0.83.1`, Java `>=17`, Applied Energistics 2 `>=15.0.10 <16.0.0` |
| `1.21.1 NeoForge` | Minecraft `[1.21.1]`, NeoForge `[21.1.1,)`, Applied Energistics 2 `[19.0.24,20.0.0)` |
| `26.1.2 NeoForge` | Minecraft `[26.1.2]`, NeoForge `[26.1.2.71,)`, Java `>=25`, Applied Energistics 2 `[26.1.10-beta,27.0.0)` |

## Dependency and integration matrix

Optional addons are not required to run AE2 Crafting Time. Declared optional
ranges have a minimum and no upper cap. Development-client pins make tests
repeatable; they do not freeze modpacks or guarantee future addon compatibility.

The four version columns record compatible development-client pins, with
focused-only and unpinned exceptions marked.
They are not minimum versions or a claim about the latest upstream release.
**Declared targets** and **Minimum version** describe loader metadata; `—` in
those columns means no separate optional dependency declaration is recorded.
It does not erase the native integration or development coverage in the row.
Required versions are listed above.

The prepared Fabric client disables Fabric's development-only mod shuffle so
initialization order matches a normal installed client. With random dev order,
ExtendedAE `1.20-1.0.2-fabric` can call AE2WTLib `15.2.1` before its universal
terminal item exists and crash in `WUTHandler.addTerminal`. This is a development
profile setting, not an upstream addon fix; all pinned addons remain installed.

The Fabric development runtime also loads MixinExtras `0.5.5`. It fixes world-entry
crashes when newer Fabric Mixin versions compile `Redirect.at` as an array.
This runtime-only dependency is not bundled in the published mod JAR.

`Yes (base)` means the Forge driver exercises the dependency in its base AE2
scenario; `Yes (scenario)` or a scenario name means a dedicated driver exists.
`No` means no driver for that target; `Not pinned` means declared support without
a compatible-client artifact; `—` in a target column means it is not part of that
target's recorded inventory. Driver availability is not a passing smoke result:
see the [campaign evidence and known visual failure](mod-automation-coverage.md).
AdvancedAE's Forge fixture verifies an enclosed Quantum Computer with an
Accelerator and Data Entangler, exact CPU submission, a fresh sample, and plan TTC.
It is development coverage, not a declared Forge dependency. Crafting Tree now has
a Forge `crafting-tree-screen` scenario for node badges, spacing, one copy of each
tooltip hint, and real details/reset input; Fabric has an eleven-case compatible
suite. NeoForge 1.21.1 has a 25-case compatible suite, and NeoForge 26.1.2 has a
fourteen-case compatible suite.

`no-provider-status` is a focused native AE2 scenario on all four targets.
Its historical Forge 1.20.1 smoke checks real pattern/provider removal, bilingual
tooltips, recovery, redundant providers, and cancellation. New campaigns use
English only. The other target
drivers compile; this result does not claim their runtime smoke or a full
optional-mod graph run.

## Compatibility boundaries

- `NO PROVIDER` observes the standard AE2 dispatch lookup on all four targets
  and AdvancedAE's equivalent lookup on Forge 1.20.1 and both NeoForge targets.
  The verified AdvancedAE artifacts are `1.3.6-1.20.1`, CurseForge file `7849217`,
  and `26.1.7`. Other custom dispatch engines are not claimed by this diagnostic.
  This source/bytecode verification does not add a live UI-smoke result.

- Lightning Tech `1.0.1alpha-26.1.2neoforge` uses `@OnlyIn`, which triggers a
  NeoForge development warning screen. The 26.1.2 client runs use NeoForge's
  `neoforge.warnings.onlyin.hide` option to skip that screen while keeping the
  diagnostics in the log. This does not fix Lightning Tech's annotations or
  change the server run; the reported client log ended with a normal shutdown.
- Applied Mekanistics has Forge/NeoForge releases for these targets. Applied
  Flux has no stable Fabric 1.20.1 release. Neither is declared for Fabric.
- Applied Botanics original and fork share `appbot`, its version, and mana key;
  install one, not both. Both use raw mana and Botania 455 on Forge 1.20.1.
  The fork has no recorded Fabric, NeoForge 1.21.1, or 26.1.2 artifact.
  Original 1.21.1 support starts at `1.6.0-alpha.3` and requires Botania
  `454-SNAPSHOT` (`vazkii.botania:botania-neoforge-1.21.1:454-20260621.181850-47`),
  with no matching published Modrinth release. No original 26.1.2 artifact is
  recorded. The Forge driver covers native mana storage plus normal item
  crafting, not a mana-generation recipe.
- AppliedE and AppliedE TPS Fix are alternative artifacts: install one, not both.
  The NeoForge 1.21.1 client pins AppliedE `1.0.1-beta`: ExtendedAE
  `1.21-2.2.35-neoforge` expects `LEARNING_CARD` to be a `DeferredItem`, while
  AppliedE `1.0.0-beta` exposes a `Supplier` and crashes during common setup.
  `1.0.1-beta` is the first release with the matching field type. This client
  constraint does not raise AE2 Crafting Time's standalone AppliedE minimum.
- AEInfinityBooster uses AE2's normal Crafting Plan and has no recorded Fabric
  release for the supported target. Advanced Peripherals has no recorded Fabric
  1.20.1 or NeoForge 26.1.2 release; NeoForge 1.21.1 uses an alpha.
- AE2 Things uses the original Fabric release and a separate Forge/NeoForge
  port. The latter has no old Inscriber or Crystal Growth Chamber. NeoForge
  `1.4.2-beta` is compile-checked, not promoted to the compatible runtime without
  a smoke run. No 26.1.2 artifact is recorded.
- Expanded AE has no recorded Fabric 1.20.1 or NeoForge 26.1.2 artifact. Its
  Applied Flux/OmniSequence conflict excludes it from the full compatible set;
  the [client coverage notes](mod-automation-coverage.md#client-setup-and-exclusions)
  explain the focused profile and missing upstream prerequisite declarations.
- WCWT, AE2 Wireless Terminals, and Import Export Card label one-item estimates
  `TTC: ~1s` or `TTC: No data yet`, after AE2's amount, craftability, and advanced
  details. Other mods may append content afterward. Compact row badges retain
  their existing text.

## Integration approach

Start with AE2's CPU, key, and UI contracts. Add addon-specific code only when
source inspection proves that an addon bypasses them. Reuse `ClientStats`,
`TimeEstimate`, and `AeKeyAmounts`; add a compile-time dependency only when AE2
APIs or an optional string-target mixin cannot reach the screen or key type.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Native CPU execution | `CraftingCpuLogicMixin`, including OmniSequence and other addons inheriting its methods | An override bypasses only the method it replaces. Provider observation uses the selected iterator, so it doesn't compete with OmniSequence's provider lookup wrapper. AdvancedAE uses the same observation point. |
| Custom CPU adapter | AdvancedAE, NeoEco, and LightningTech call `ProfilerBridge` at dispatch, insertion, finish, and capacity points | Use a small optional `@Pseudo` mixin for custom execution. NeoEco uses `cn.dancingsnow.neoecoae.api.me.ECOCraftingCPULogic`; LightningTech uses `com.moakiee.ae2lt.crafting.timewheel.Ae2LtTimeWheelCraftingCpuLogic`. |
| Native resource key | `AeKeyAmounts` normalizes `AEKey` through `getAmountPerUnit()` | Verify each key type; use `AEKeyType`, not addon class checks. Preserve raw-mana precision. |
| Existing AE2 UI hooks | Craft-confirm and crafting-status renderers and screens inheriting their hooked methods | `AbstractTableRendererMixin` only decorates TTC lines; inheritance alone does not prove every screen path is covered. |
| Bespoke UI hook | Crafting Tree, ME Requester, WCWT, Wireless Terminals, and Import Export Card | Add an optional screen-specific mixin only where the shared UI path does not reach. Advanced Peripherals uses native submission and needs no extra TTC API. |
| Planned service observation | A proof-of-coverage spike may observe `CraftingService.submitJob`, `getCpus`, and busy-state changes | Only covers exposed CPUs and job lifecycle; cannot produce output-throughput samples. A shared `AEBaseScreen` hook also remains conditional on one usable common method. |

Automatic `ICraftingCPU` discovery and a Mixin plugin do not replace execution
adapters: the interface exposes status, capacity, and cancellation, not dispatch
and accepted-output events. `getGrid()` and `getLevel()` are concrete CPU methods;
check the supplying addon class before using them in an adapter.

The [addon integration spec](ae2-addon-integration/spec.md),
[technical design](ae2-addon-integration/technical-design.md), and
[implementation plan](ae2-addon-integration/implementation-plan.md) retain the
full requirements and rollout. Tracking issues in the matrix identify that work;
they do not claim a current issue state.

## Build tools and sources

Build the 1.20.1 modules with Java 17, 1.21.1 NeoForge with Java 21, and
26.1.2 NeoForge with Java 25.

Declared support comes from [the release matrix](../scripts/release-matrix.json)
and loader metadata. Client pins come from
[run-client-versions.json](../scripts/run-client-versions.json); scenarios live in
[the Forge test driver](../versions/1.20.1-forge/src/testDriver).

The native AE2 and supported AdvancedAE dispatch hooks now share the NO PROVIDER /
NO POWER status transport. NO POWER observes only the real simulated AE network
energy extraction. All four prepared compatible suites include both native
status scenarios; their results apply only to the actual tested artifacts.

Standard AE2 coverage now expands into six independent leaves before full-suite
execution (34/16/30/19 cases for Forge 1.20.1, Fabric 1.20.1, NeoForge 1.21.1,
and NeoForge 26.1.2). A focused leaf pass does not certify a dependency's full
standard group. Optional integrations keep their existing scenario names and
newest-adapter obligations; change selection does not alter dependency pins.
