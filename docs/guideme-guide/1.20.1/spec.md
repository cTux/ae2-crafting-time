# Minecraft 1.20.1 Guide Book Specification

Issue: [#265](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/issues/265)

This extends the implemented [modern guide specification](../spec.md) to both
Minecraft 1.20.1 loaders without changing its content or modern targets.

## Player behavior

- Forge and Fabric players can craft **AE2 Crafting Time Guide** from one book,
  one uncharged Certus Quartz Crystal, and one clock in any arrangement.
- The recipe consumes all three ingredients and produces one guide. The crafted
  stack uses the vanilla book model and keeps its identity through inventory
  synchronization and world save/reload.
- Using the guide in either hand opens the introduction. English and Ukrainian
  navigation contains the introduction and **Chapter 1: Your first estimate**,
  matching the content already shipped on modern NeoForge.
- Opening never consumes or damages the guide. Missing optional Forge GuideME
  support never exposes a recipe whose result cannot open.

## Platform rules

### Forge 1.20.1

- GuideME `20.1.15` is optional on both client and server.
- The recipe exists only when `guideme` is loaded and produces `guideme:guide`
  with string NBT `guideId: "ae2craftingtime:guide"`.
- AE2 Crafting Time starts without GuideME and does not resolve GuideME classes,
  register guide-only integrations, or expose the guide recipe.
- Published Modrinth/CurseForge relations list GuideME as optional only for this
  Forge row.

### Fabric 1.20.1

- Use AE2 15.x's bundled `ae2guide` renderer and addon resource namespace. Do
  not declare or publish a GuideME dependency.
- Register an `ae2craftingtime:guide` item with the vanilla book model and
  localized name. Its use action opens
  `ae2craftingtime:index.md` through AE2's guide API.
- Package the same source Markdown in AE2's
  `assets/ae2craftingtime/ae2guide/` layout for this target.

The different stack implementations are an internal loader boundary. Their
name, model, recipe ingredients, content, navigation, and use behavior match.

## Compatibility and non-goals

- Support the current AE2 15.x compatibility range on both 1.20.1 rows. Forge
  also supports GuideME from `20.1.15` within its compatible 20.1 line.
- Keep the existing guide ID and shared English/Ukrainian Markdown source.
- Do not add GuideME to Fabric, replace AE2's bundled guidebook, fork the content,
  change modern NeoForge recipes, add new chapters, or change AE2 Crafting Time
  gameplay/profiling behavior.
- No custom renderer, model texture, screen, packet, persistence format, or
  server-side guide state.

## Acceptance criteria

- Forge with GuideME 20.1.15 shows the recipe, crafts the legacy-NBT guide, opens
  both pages in English and Ukrainian, and preserves identity after sync/reload.
- Forge without GuideME starts client and dedicated server cleanly and has no
  guide recipe or premature optional-class loading.
- Fabric crafts and opens the registered guide through AE2 15.x, renders both
  locales/navigation, and preserves item identity after sync/reload.
- Both loaders accept every ingredient order in 2x2 and 3x3 grids, consume the
  three inputs, produce one guide, and reject charged Certus/dust/substitutes.
- Metadata and release relations match actual platform availability; modern
  NeoForge guide behavior does not regress.
- Focused prepared-client smoke covers crafting, both hands, navigation,
  localization, inventory synchronization, world reload, and the Forge-without-
  GuideME case. Player JARs contain no test driver.
