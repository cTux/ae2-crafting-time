# Optional client and server installation

Status: ready-to-implement

Scope: Optional Crafting Time installation on either side of a connection.

Issue: [#537](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/issues/537)

Planning: [Technical design](technical-design.md) and [implementation plan](implementation-plan.md).

Verification scope: Add a focused observation mode to the existing test driver
and connected runner, as defined in the design. Install production and driver only
on the sides marked installed; inspect absent clients through the VM framebuffer.
Complete and verify this prerequisite before the connected campaign.

## Behavior

Crafting Time must be optional on either side of an otherwise compatible AE2
connection. This does not relax Minecraft, loader, AE2, or other mods' requirements.

| Client | Server | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installed | Installed | Existing profiling, UI, packets, warnings and options work. |
| Absent | Installed | Login works; server collection and saved history remain usable; no Crafting Time payload goes to this client. |
| Installed | Absent | Login works; no Crafting Time payload goes to the server; AE2 displays and controls retain native behavior. |
| Absent | Absent | Native AE2 behavior remains unchanged. |

Client-only fallback covers totals, row estimates, CPU ordering, sort controls,
amount formatting, tooltips, status text, locate/reset/detail actions and optional
integration UI. Saved local preferences remain available through the loader's
configuration entry, but they cannot enable connection-dependent behavior.
Server settings are unavailable without a supporting server.

Singleplayer with the mod installed continues through the integrated server's
normal networking path. Connecting to a supported server re-enables features
without restarting the client or rewriting its preferences.

## Acceptance criteria

- OC-1: Both-installed, server-only, client-only and neither-installed logins
  succeed on Forge 1.20.1, Fabric 1.20.1, NeoForge 1.21.1 and NeoForge 26.1.2.
- OC-2: Every custom outbound payload checks peer support before transmission;
  an unsupported peer receives none, including login and unsolicited updates.
- OC-3: Unsupported-server UI matches native AE2, including the amount-formatting
  paths and optional integrations, with no stale estimate or actionable mod control.
- OC-4: Supported to unsupported to supported transitions in one client process,
  plus disconnect/reconnect, reset capability, stats, network amounts, CPU state,
  highlights and request cooldowns. Late work from an old connection cannot populate
  the new connection's state.
- OC-5: Both-installed and integrated singleplayer preserve existing behavior;
  server-only crafts still populate and retain history across a server restart.
- OC-6: Existing incompatible-present protocol handling, bounded codecs, request
  authorization and persisted data remain intact. Absence is not version compatibility.
- OC-7: Installation guidance, the GuideME book and GitHub wiki explain these
  combinations and when Crafting Time features are available.
- OC-8: Evidence for all sixteen connected cells records exact artifacts, login,
  payload observation, UI/profiling results, timestamps and cleanup. Source inspection
  or a successful login alone does not prove a cell passed.

## Boundaries

No new gameplay feature, packet format, saved-data migration or dependency is
required. Capability is a connection fact, not a user preference: users cannot
override an absent peer into accepting packets. Existing feature switches remain.
Do not weaken tests, coverage or handshake protection to make absence work.
