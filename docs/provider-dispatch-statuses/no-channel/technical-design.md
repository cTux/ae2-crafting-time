# NO CHANNEL research and technical design

Implements the [specification](spec.md), tracked in
[#405](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/issues/405).

## Verified evidence

Repository baseline: [415248db685390f5fb93736d8b874010a869f8e1](https://github.com/cTux/ae2-crafting-time/tree/415248db685390f5fb93736d8b874010a869f8e1),
equal to fetched `origin/master` on 2026-09-13. This is source research, not
compiled-hook or in-game proof. The following pinned AE2 sources were fetched
and inspected for all four dependency defaults in `versions/*/build.gradle`.

Implementation investigation on 2026-09-14 used current master
`9ed01be4355d04e52baf3fc33b9e2e58d02de045`, which contains the planning merge
`133de96e86bfe42d3c4eccb31362d62be1df74c2`. Read-only `javap -c` inspection of
the four cached pinned artifacts below confirmed the send-list short circuit,
activity check before the lock lookup, and unconditional pattern-list getter.
No repository tests or Minecraft scenarios ran during that investigation.

After the requested rebase, the planning base is
`acee74e24b1d49c2002ac1006b247a75703d2904`. Its #419 change guards a null
Crafting Plan during recurrence reset; it does not change this dispatch flow,
protocol table or fixture boundary. Preserve its dependency notes.

All four share the relevant behavior:

- `getAvailablePatterns()` returns the patterns without checking activity.
- `pushPattern` first rejects a nonempty send queue, an inactive `mainNode`,
  or a pattern it no longer owns, before the lock/target/input checks.
- `isBusy()` checks the send queue, not channel availability.
- `IGridNode.isActive()` combines power, finished boot, and channel requirements.
  `meetsChannelRequirements()` is true for a node not requiring a channel or
  when its allocated channel count is positive. `hasGridBooted()` excludes
  pathing recalculation. Therefore `!isActive()` is not a channel diagnosis.

The [official channels guide](https://guide.appliedenergistics.org/1.21.1/ae2-mechanics/channels)
also explains that routing can leave devices without channels even when spare
capacity exists elsewhere. The tooltip deliberately avoids naming an exact
cable or assuming a fixed capacity; use the node API, including channel modes.

Current project behavior is confirmed in `shared/src/mcCommon/java/com/ctux/
ae2craftingtime/mc1201/{ProviderDispatchObserver,ProviderDispatchContext}.java`
and `mixin/PatternProviderLogicMixin.java`: the first observed provider check
is the lock lookup, so inactivity exits with an unchecked frame and UNKNOWN.
Both `ProfilerBridge` variants test provider-list presence for NO PROVIDER,
not activity. A first-dispatch waiting timer consequently remains Waiting.

## Observe the actual guard

Extend the existing `PatternProviderLogicMixin` in `mcCommon`; no new mixin
registration, provider registry, dependency, or CPU hook is needed. Wrap the
existing `IManagedGridNode.isActive()Z` invocation inside `pushPattern` with
MixinExtras `WrapOperation`. Call the original once and return its unchanged
boolean. Read that receiver's nullable `getNode()` and convert its presence,
power, boot, and channel results to facts for the current dispatch frame.
Observe only the matched provider frame in `ProviderDispatchContext`.

Put the classification predicate in the Minecraft-free `ProviderDispatchTracker`:
an observed failed activity check plus a present, powered, booted node with
unmet channel requirements proves `AttemptResult.NO_CHANNEL`. The adapter
only extracts facts and delegates. No inference from a generic false push,
client cache, block position, `getUsedChannels()` heuristic, or `isOnline()`.
An absent node is unknown. If the queue short-circuits the activity check,
the new fact is never observed. Power loss and reboot remain unknown here;
they do not create NO POWER, which retains its dispatch-energy meaning.

In `ProviderDispatchContext.Frame.finish`, preserve SUCCESS first, then return
NO CHANNEL for the proven activity rejection before the existing unchecked
fallback. Existing lock/target/input handling stays intact. Calls outside a
CPU dispatch frame add no state. Nested frames retain existing scope behavior.
An addon overriding the method participates only if it actually executes this
guard and returns a failed dispatch through the observed path; success wins.

Extend `ProviderDispatchTracker.AttemptResult` and append `NO_CHANNEL` to
`CraftingBlockReason`. Replace the current final "otherwise LOCKED" mapping
with an explicit mapping that covers the new result. Preserve `Evaluation`'s
unanimous-reason rule: complete iteration, at least one candidate, no success,
no unknown/busy alternative, and agreement among all observed failures.
Do not rescan `CraftingService.getProviders()`; the existing native and
AdvancedAE observers see the iterable selected after addon wrappers.

## State, recovery, and ordering

Reuse `ProviderDispatchTracker`'s per-CPU/per-pattern failures and positive
output keys. Add NO CHANNEL to its accepted reasons and rank it above LOCKED.
Its existing 20-tick expiry, backwards-tick invalidation, replacement, and
cleanup implement NC-05. Do not retain provider nodes or allocate a second
tracker. An old observation can remain until expiry if dispatch stops; that
bounded observation is not a claim that a fresh channel check occurred.

`CraftProfiler.blockReasons` already overlays dispatch reasons beneath
NO PROVIDER/NO POWER using `putAll`. Preserve that ordering and the
selected-scope remembered-status rules. `rememberBlockReason` explicitly
whitelists only NO PROVIDER and NO POWER; retain that whitelist. Do not append
to `StatusKind` or modify `PersistedStatusTag`/SavedData. Save/reopen and runtime
reload must not alias NO CHANNEL to another remembered status.

No polling, insertion simulation, forced dispatch, channel-mode changes, or
inventory mutation is added for diagnostics. Successful dispatch learning,
total TTC, `ProviderStartTracker`, notifications, locate, and plates stay intact.

## Transport, rendering, and target boundaries

Reuse `blockReasons` in the existing snapshot, `StatsPacketCodec`, and
`ClientStatsCache`. Preserve MAX_KEYS, enum validation, requested-key filtering,
authorized menu/CPU context, request rate limits, and replacement of omitted
requested keys even without samples. New enum values are a wire boundary:

| Loader | Inspected boundary | Planned boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forge 1.20.1 | `PROTOCOL = "18"` | `19` |
| Fabric 1.20.1 | `stats_snapshot_v9` | `stats_snapshot_v10` |
| NeoForge 1.21.1 / 26.1.2 | registrar `17` | `18` on both |

If the implementation base advances, increment that current boundary once;
never reuse an incompatible identifier or roll it back. Preserve Fabric's
capability check and existing mismatched-peer policy. No saved-data migration.

Add badge recognition in `CraftingRowState` and include NO CHANNEL in
`TtcText.isDispatchReason` for the mixed-row qualifier. Generic
`TtcText.blockReason` already supplies the bold red style and translation key.
The shared `CraftingStatusTableRendererMixin` and both
`CraftingCPUScreenMixin` variants must retain pending-only rendering and
unknown-time sorting. Add the exact three locale keys from the spec in
English/Ukrainian; document the new status in both GuideME locale trees.
Update `docs/dependencies.md` to describe the verified integration scope,
without raising minimums or claiming arbitrary provider-addon support.

Common logic goes in `shared/src/main`; Minecraft adapters go in `mcCommon`.
Review both `mc1201` and `mc2612` bridges/codecs/screens and all four loader
wrappers. The existing `neoforge` AdvancedAE CPU adapter is also compiled for
Forge 1.20.1; it must exercise the same observer on its three applicable targets.
No new bespoke adapters for unrelated CPU/provider addons. Existing retained
variants still need contract/packaging coverage; live tests use the newest
implemented adapter. See the [implementation plan](implementation-plan.md).

## Book and Wiki delivery

The canonical book lives under `shared/src/main/resources/assets/
ae2craftingtime/guides/ae2craftingtime/guide/`. Add `statuses/no-channel.md`
and its `_uk_ua` peer after NO POWER and before LOCKED, matching reason priority.
Update both status indexes, adjacent page links and following navigation positions.
Extend `build.gradle`'s ordered `statusPages` map; retain its locale, label,
image, reachability and previous/next/return-link checks. Each page uses the same
reviewed English PNG with translated caption/alt text. Obtain the crop from
the actual NO CHANNEL smoke evidence through the guide-image refresh workflow;
do not manufacture an image or weaken the image check.

Follow the existing [Wiki conventions](../../guideme-guide/status-chapter/technical-design.md#github-wiki-update-s14)
in the separate `ae2-crafting-time.wiki.git` repository. Mirror the completed
book as `Status-No-Channel.md` and `Ukrainian-Status-No-Channel.md`, stripping
frontmatter and adapting links to Wiki page names. Update `Statuses.md`,
`Ukrainian-Statuses.md`, adjacent NO POWER/LOCKED navigation and any existing
sidebar status listing. Reuse the reviewed PNG and preserve unrelated Wiki work.
The text must distinguish Waiting, missing provider lookup and dispatch power
from a proven provider-channel failure. Published pages and links are a separate
completion gate; a local Wiki diff or book resource check is not publication.

AE2 15.4.10 completes path recalculation and raises then clears its booting
state inside one server-end-tick call. The native driver therefore verifies a
real `repath()` boundary on a later server tick, with the provider powered,
booted and still channel-starved and the refreshed UI still showing NO CHANNEL.
It does not claim a transient client-visible boot frame. The pure-state
`ProviderDispatchContextTest.classifiesOnlyDirectCompleteProviderEvidence`
case covers powered but not booted evidence remaining UNKNOWN.

## Verification infrastructure boundary

The existing `DispatchStatusFixture` connects nodes directly with
`GridHelper.createConnection` and waits for an already dispatched native batch.
That setup cannot prove initial channel starvation. Extend the feature fixture
with a real controller/cable bottleneck and a submission path that accepts zero
active output while scheduled work is positive. Reuse native and
`AdvancedAeStatusFixture` CPU construction, but fail an AdvancedAE-required
case if the addon or selected AdvancedAE CPU is missing; silent native fallback
cannot satisfy AC-06. Register `no-channel-status` through existing driver,
planner and evidence contracts. These feature-specific extensions are part of
#405, not a new runner or infrastructure project. The
[driver design](../../test-driver/technical-design.md#no-channel-status-fixture)
owns asynchronous operations, real topology and reset details.

Prepared source worlds and the existing disposable-copy path are present.
Fabric intentionally uses the Forge source marker; both NeoForge targets have
their own `SOURCE_ONLY` markers. The host has Java 17, 21 and 25. The existing
[host/guest staging path](../../dev-client.md#host-build-and-vm-staging) provides
exact-worktree sharing and native-loader launches. Runtime preflight on
2026-09-14 confirmed SSH access, all four guest `prepared/<target>/launch.json`
files and Java 17.0.20.1/21.0.12.1/25.0.4.1. Fabric libraries/assets and the
versioned Forge 47.4.23 manifest's classpath exist. Default Forge 47.4.10 and
NeoForge 21.1.238/26.1.2.99 each reference one absent synthetic version JAR;
whether those entries affect native launch remains unresolved. The existing
dispatcher's `vmrun getGuestIPAddress -wait` successfully resolves the guest;
no runner change is needed. Before runtime execution, validate the selected
manifest against the resolved loader and check those classpath references
through the existing launcher path. These are pending
launch gates, not proof that the loaders are absent or that smoke passed.
Use the existing prepared installation path if provisioning is needed; do not
substitute a different loader or profile. Recheck exact-worktree sharing and
previous-client cleanup before the campaign.

## Review decisions

- Generic inactivity was rejected: it would mislabel power loss and reboot.
- Merely finding one starved provider was rejected: another provider may work.
- New persistent state was rejected: current dispatch tracking already owns
  exact-pattern aggregation and bounded recovery.
- This source-backed design still needs compiled descriptor checks and actual
  saturated-channel fixtures; no runtime success is claimed by this plan.
