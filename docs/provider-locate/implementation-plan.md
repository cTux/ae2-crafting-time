# Provider Locate Implementation Plan

The phases below describe the original feature. The final section is the
current planned correction for #443; it does not repeat the original work.
Let the commit hook create the PR, then use required CI as the first Gradle
test run.

## Phase 1: Track dispatched patterns per craft

1. Add a Minecraft-facing tracker keyed by crafting CPU identity holding each
   output's dispatched patterns.
2. Record the pattern for its output keys inside both `ProfilerBridge`
   `observeProviders` paths (standard/AdvancedAE and ECO/TimeWheel funnel
   through the same two methods).
3. Clear one scope in `ProfilerBridge.startJob` and `finishJob` beside the
   existing pending/owner cleanup.
4. Resolve positions only at notify time: providers from the crafting
   service, identity-matched to grid nodes, `InWorldGridNode` locations
   only, capped at the new packet limit.

## Phase 2: Message, command, and highlight packet

1. Split `chat.delayed` so the status word is a separate red translatable;
   keep four matching placeholders in English and Ukrainian.
2. Underline the output name with a hover hint and a run-command click event
   while a record exists; render a plain name otherwise.
3. Add the shared Brigadier locate command (permission 0, owner-must-match
   plus active-job and valid-target checks) and register it on each loader's
   command event.
4. Add the shared highlight codec (`networkId, dimensionId, positions,
   outputId, durationSeconds, plateOnly`) plus one S2C wrapper, registration
   line, and send helper per loader. `plateOnly=true` is red-plate-only
   (automatic); `false` is rainbow-edge-only (manual); empty positions with
   zero duration clears one plate and keeps rainbow.
5. Set Forge channel protocol `14`, Fabric `provider_highlight_v4` plus
   `provider_locate_v1`, NeoForge registrars `13` on 1.21.1 and 26.1.2.
   Keep `networkId` and stored `dimension` additive with tolerant reads.
6. Add the client highlight store with independent lifetimes: plates persist
   until server clear, provider break, or session end; edges expire after 15
   seconds. Both blink. Never consult the UI cache; never silently evict.
   One render hook per loader draws rainbow edges and red plates in the
   matching dimension, with shared broken-target trim.

Changing the wire registry affects every supported loader, so complete these
steps in the same commit.

## Phase 3: Persist links and re-warn after reload

1. Add the per-key provider-start section (network, output, owner, dimension,
   positions, display name) to all four `Ae2CraftingTimeSavedData` files with
   tolerant reads; do not bump the samples version. Never persist rainbow.
2. Snapshot the section whenever records change, a job owner is set, or a
   load happens; restore it in `ProfilerBridge.load`.
3. Fall back to the persisted owner and positions when live dispatch data is
   absent, so resumed crafts warn again with a working link after reload.
   Login resync re-sends plates for still-delayed crafts (chat never re-sent)
   with server-side broken-target filtering; unloaded stays unknown and kept.
4. Answer clicks on missing, foreign, finished, cancelled, or broken records
   with the private expiry notice and forget broken records.
5. Double-click means "any active crafting item" (server validates scope,
   ownership, and resolvability); `notifyOnDelayed` means "chat only" and
   never gates plates, clears, or resync. Document both explicitly.

## Phase 4: Blocked warnings (NO SPACE, NO POWER)

1. Add a tiny pure-core episode tracker (one instance per reason) with tests
   for once-per-episode, re-arm, scope independence, and null safety.
2. Add the server-side `NO SPACE` probe reading the AE2-mirrored status
   methods through reflection, with graceful empty results.
3. Notify per reason from every CPU tick path (power everywhere, space
   everywhere) plus a power-only backup on status requests, sharing chat
   records only. Blocked warnings never create or clear red plates and never
   update the provider fallback.
4. Add the shared three-placeholder blocked sentence with per-reason red
   status words in both languages; reuse the clickable name for edge-only
   manual locates.
5. Extend the message, placeholder, and language tests.
6. Update the spec, design, and protocol doc sections.

## Phase 5: Tests, docs, and verification

1. Add codec round-trip tests (network, positions, dimension, duration,
   plateOnly, oversize rejection, legacy defaults) and NBT round-trip tests
   (records, owners, stored dimension, legacy saves).
2. Add message-component tests: red status word, underlined clickable name
   with hover text, plain fallback, and placeholder parity.
3. Add lifecycle tests: auto plate without edge, manual edge without plate,
   independent clear, provider-break trim, session-end clear, no silent
   eviction, network-scoped independence, blocked never touches red.
4. Update `docs/server-client-stats.md` (packet, command, persistence) and
   index the feature in `docs/feature-coverage.md` and `README.md`.
5. After the hook-created PR exists:
   1. Let required CI run every supported Gradle row and the coverage gate.
   2. Check the full warning/error sweep and fix repository-owned warnings.
   3. In a development client, stall a craft and verify red plates appear
      with no click; click the item name or double-click any active item and
      verify rainbow edges blink for 15 seconds without changing red.
   4. Recover one output and verify red clears while rainbow continues;
      finish or cancel and verify the same. Break one provider and verify
      only its plate and outline drop.
   5. Re-enter the world and verify red returns for still-delayed crafts,
      rainbow never returns, and active chat links still work.

## #443: one delayed output per provider

Status: planned, not implemented. Follow the
[specification](spec.md#acceptance-for-443) and
[source evidence and design](technical-design.md#443-one-display-per-provider-position).
Complete the correction as one conventional fix commit after review; do not
run local tests before the hook-created implementation PR exists.

1. **Confirm verification access.** Before a build or smoke campaign, check the
   exact CodexVM, guest JDKs, prepared native launch manifests and disposable
   fixture path below. Resolve missing installations through the documented
   prepared-client workflow. Do not silently add a runner or provisioning
   system. A missing prerequisite without an existing provisioning path needs
   a separately documented prerequisite or explicit authority before expanding
   this issue.
2. **Select the display.** Add the smallest pure selection operation under
   `shared/src/main/java` and a separate rendering view in
   `ProviderHighlightClient`. Retain raw `plates()` and every delayed identity.
   Select the first retained candidate per dimension/position, collapsing
   duplicate positions while preserving other positions and dimensions.
3. **Wire every renderer.** Replace raw plate iteration in Forge 1.20.1,
   Fabric 1.20.1 and NeoForge 1.21.1. Update both the plate and item-submit
   loops in NeoForge 26.1.2. Keep geometry, buffer flushes and edge paths intact.
4. **Add focused regressions.** Cover the new pure operation's lines and
   branches completely. Extend the nearest client boundary tests for stable
   updates, selection after clear/trim and retained losing identities. Review
   every renderer call site against the same output contract.
5. **Verify after PR creation.** Run the focused tests and shared coverage
   checks, then compile the affected four targets. Track required GitHub CI
   separately (`test jacocoTestReport`, including the shared 100% gate).
   Preview `scripts/run-ui-smoke.ps1 -Changed -BaseRef origin/master -PlanOnly`
   and retain its selection. Run the required selection after the representative
   overlap case passes; report any broader suites selected by current policy.
   Selection rules can choose CPU-list or full-suite coverage for these paths,
   so also run the explicit overlap check below. Do not weaken selection rules
   to obtain a smaller campaign.
6. **Review evidence and close the documentation gap.** Bind checks, captures
   and reports to the implementation head. Review the single-icon center,
   several successive frames, survivor transition, red pulse and rainbow
   behavior. Keep unrun cases and visual-review requirements explicit. Only
   after the criteria pass should the documents describe the fix as shipped.

### Criteria mapped to checks

| Criteria | Change and check |
| --- | --- |
| P443-1, P443-4 | Pure selection: empty input, one candidate, several candidates, repeated positions, partial overlap, different dimensions and different networks at one position. Assert exact selected outputs and unique positions. |
| P443-2 | Pure ordering checks and `ProviderPlatesTest`: repeated reads, updating the winner, updating a loser and adding a later candidate preserve the first retained winner. |
| P443-3, P443-5 | Client boundary checks: clear winner/loser, trim a position, clear the last candidate and end the session; assert retained identities and independent edge state as well as selected displays. Check unknown/non-item output selection without inventing a registry fallback. |
| P443-1, P443-2, P443-6 | Review all four render adapters and both 26.1.2 passes; compile all targets. Reviewed overlap captures prove centering and stability in actual render pipelines. |
| P443-3, P443-5, P443-6 | Run `delayed-status` for existing automatic plate and final-output cleanup coverage; perform the additional overlap/recovery/manual-locate visual check below. Existing shape and timer code stays unchanged. |

### Runtime scope and prerequisites

Investigation at `818809c57cf06540b23430bb4836e06f7fd82466` verified host Java
17, 21 and 25 selection and Gradle wrapper 8.12. CodexVM exists but was stopped.
Guest Java, SSH/VNC access and prepared manifest contents remain unverified.
This is a feasibility gap, not a successful smoke run.

Use the compatible profiles in `scripts/run-client-versions.json`:

| Target | Java | Loader / AE2 at investigation | Visual role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.20.1 Forge | 17 | 47.4.10 / 15.4.10 | First overlap reproduction and older render path |
| 1.20.1 Fabric | 17 | 0.19.4 / 15.1.0; Fabric API 0.92.11+1.20.1 | Distinct immediate-buffer path |
| 1.21.1 NeoForge | 21 | 21.1.238 / 19.2.17 | Compile and client boundary coverage; run additional smoke required by change selection |
| 26.1.2 NeoForge | 25 | 26.1.2.99 / 26.1.10-beta | Separate plate and item-submit passes |

Recheck profile versions before execution. Follow `docs/dev-client.md` and the
prepared-smoke skill: build on the host, stage immutable artifacts, and launch
only the matching installed native loader in CodexVM. Check the prepared
`launch.json` at the documented guest root for the exact target/resolved loader.
Retain evidence under `build/ui-smoke`, archive it, and stop only the recorded
client before the next target. No dedicated-server campaign is needed for this
client-only selection change.

Tracked source markers exist for Forge and both NeoForge targets and use
`disposableWorldId: SOURCE_ONLY`. Fabric intentionally uses the Forge source
fixture. Use the existing runner's disposable copy and marker validation;
never launch or modify the tracked source world.

### Overlap check

The `delayed-status` leaf uses its existing prepared client and disposable world
to dispatch two distinct intermediate outputs through one provider. It waits for
both retained identities, stabilizes the single first-retained render selection,
and performs a real row locate before capturing `delayed-world-overlap.png`.
It releases that winner while the other output remains delayed, then requires
the survivor icon, red plate, and independent rainbow edge before capturing
`delayed-world-winner-recovered.png`. The existing final-output stages verify
the remaining plate clears. Review both new captures on Forge 1.20.1, then on
Fabric 1.20.1 and NeoForge 26.1.2; an automatic assertion is not visual approval.
