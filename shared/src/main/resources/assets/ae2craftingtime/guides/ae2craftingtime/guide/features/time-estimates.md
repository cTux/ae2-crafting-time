# Time estimates

Crafting Plan shows TTC beside every row that has learned timing data. The row
time covers the full **To Craft** amount, not one pattern operation. The total
below the CPU details adds the known plan rows; if some rows have no data, it is
only the known part of the job.

With **Compact crafting amounts** on, the plan shows available and to-craft
amounts on one line: `4/10`. With only one amount, `A4` means available and
`C10` means to craft. Missing and
recurrent warnings stay separate. Hover for AE2's full labeled amounts.

Crafting Status uses the same row estimates while a job runs. Its total follows
the longest remaining dependency path, so parallel branches are not added as if
they ran one after another. For example, two independent ten-second branches
can still finish in about ten seconds, while two dependent steps take about
twenty. Estimates are not deadlines: machine speed, other work, and server load
can change the result.

With the same option on, Crafting Status puts available, crafting, and scheduled
amounts on one line, in that order: `4/10/200`. A missing amount is `-`; when only one amount is
present, its `A`, `C`, or `S` prefix identifies it. Hover for AE2's full labeled
amounts. **Compact crafting amounts** starts off under **Options > Client >
Displays**. Turn it on for the compact line in both windows. This setting works
independently of row TTC.
